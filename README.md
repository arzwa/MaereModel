# MaereModel

This package implements some methods to conduct approximate Bayesian inference
for the model of [Maere et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0501102102).
This package uses the proposal kernels defined in the
[AdaptiveMCMC](https://github.com/arzwa/AdaptiveMCMC.jl) library. 

See `test/inference.jl` for an example on how to use the code.

TODO: Should look for better smoothing approaches.
